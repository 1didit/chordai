# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-12)

**Core value:** Продюсер закидає пісню-референс і за секунди отримує кілька готових до використання MIDI-акордових наборів у схожому стилі — без знання теорії музики і без ручного підбору на слух.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Plugin Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Plugin Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-07-12 — Plan 01-03 (Manual DAW Load Matrix) complete: ChordAI confirmed loading cleanly (cold scans) in Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, and Standalone, plus a DAW save/reload cycle; Phase 1 complete

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 20.3 min
- Total execution time: 1.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 1 | 48min | 48min |
| Phase 01 P02 | 7min | 3 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 01 P03 | 6min | 2 tasks | 0 files |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 48min, 7min, 6min
- Trend: Improving

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Detection engine (Phase 3, headless/testable via harness) split from analysis UI wiring (Phase 4, background-thread + progress + timeline display) — isolates highest-uncertainty DSP work from UI/threading debugging, per research recommendation.
- Roadmap: ANL-04 (background thread + progress shown) placed in Phase 4 not Phase 3 — "UI stays responsive" and "progress is shown" are only observable with a UI present.
- Roadmap: Preview (PRV-01) grouped with Export (Phase 6) rather than Generation (Phase 5) — both are row-level interactions in the same UI component (MidiRowComponent), audition happens "before dragging out."
- [Phase 01-01]: Root project() declares LANGUAGES C CXX (not CXX-only) to fix CMake Generate-step failure caused by JUCE's nested project() only scoping C-language rules to its own subdirectory
- [Phase 01-01]: Pinned JUCE submodule at tag 8.0.14 (newest 8.0.x available at execution time), superseding the 8.0.13 research floor
- [Phase 01]: No contingency fixes needed — auval, pluginval strictness 5 (VST3+AU), and Standalone smoke test all passed cleanly against the unmodified Plan 01 skeleton (empty ParameterLayout, stereo bus config).
- [Phase 01-plugin-foundation]: Phase 1 plugin shell (Plan 01 skeleton) confirmed loading cleanly in Ableton Live, FL Studio, and Logic Pro on cold rescans, plus a DAW project save/reload cycle, with zero source changes needed — PLT-01 fully evidenced, Phase 1 complete.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Core Chord-Detection Engine) is flagged by research as highest-uncertainty — recommend `/gsd:research-phase` before planning to firm up CQT/chroma/HMM parameters.
- Phase 6 (Row Preview & Export) drag-and-drop has documented DAW-specific fragility (Ableton/FL Studio) — recommend a research/spike pass before considering the phase done.
- Legal gate: DSP dependencies must be MIT/BSD/Apache/zlib only (no GPL/AGPL) — applies to Phase 3, already resolved as a stack decision but must be enforced per-dependency.
